Given a CSV file with the following columns including a header row:
    Account ID,Account Name,First Name,Created On
And a Restful Status API:
    https://interview.wpengine.io/v1/accounts/{account_id}
that returns information in a JSON format of:
    {"account_id": 12345, "status": "good", "created_on": "2011-01-12"}
where the "Account ID" in the CSV lines up with the "account_id" in the API
  and the "created_on" in API represents when the status was set

For every line of data in the CSV, we want to pull the information from the API for the Account ID
Merge it with the CSV data to output into a new CSV with columns of:
    Account ID,First Name,Created On,Status,Status Set On
